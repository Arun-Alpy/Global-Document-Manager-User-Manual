Note: The print option for "Txt" files is not enabled due to the following reasons:

The print option is not supported for documents of type "Text" files.
Internet browsers no longer support Java applets due to increased security, which is required to print "Text" files.
If you try to print a "Text" file, you will see a message indicating that the print option is not enabled.

By following these steps, you can print a document, except for "Text" files, which have limited print functionality due to browser security restrictions.
