### Mandatory Fields and Validations

When editing document properties, certain fields are mandatory and must be filled in. These fields are marked with a red star symbol.

* Mandatory Fields:
    - Mandatory editable fields cannot be empty. If a mandatory field is left empty, an error message "This value is required" will be displayed.
    - The following fields are mandatory and require user input when uploading documents manually:

* Field Validations:
    - Each property has its own set of validation rules. For example, the Document Type ID field requires a valid value to be selected.
    - If a mandatory field is empty or invalid, an error message will be displayed, and the user will not be able to save the changes.
    - Refer to the [Validations](https://pages.github.ibm.com/Global-EJS/GEJS-Australia-EDM-User-Manual/docs/DocumentImport/CommonFunctionalities/Validations.html) page for more details on the specific validation rules for each property.
