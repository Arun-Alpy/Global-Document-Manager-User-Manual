### Role-Based Changes
The system has undergone role-based changes to ensure that users can only access and perform actions that are relevant to their role. The following roles have been defined:

1. **Business Team Records Admin**: This role has full access to all documents and can perform all actions, including upload, delete, and edit.
2. **Business Team Upload User**: This role can upload documents but cannot delete existing documents.
3. **Business Team View User**: This role can view and download documents but cannot upload, delete, or edit documents.
4. **Technical Team Prod Support User**: This role is for technical team members to support the application and has limited access to documents.

**Role-Based Access Control**:

* Each role has been assigned specific permissions and access controls to ensure that users can only perform actions that are relevant to their role.
* The system checks the user's role and permissions before allowing them to perform any action.
* Users can only access documents and features that are relevant to their role.

**Benefits of Role-Based Changes**:

* Improved security: By limiting access to sensitive documents and features, the system reduces the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
* Increased productivity: Users can focus on their specific tasks and responsibilities without being overwhelmed by unnecessary features or documents.
* Better compliance: The system ensures that users comply with organizational policies and procedures by limiting their access to specific documents and features.
